Simply set reminders so you wouldn't get carried away with browsing.. remind yourself of online stuff that you want to do later, job tasks that need to be done at a specific time, or just about anything that you would hate to miss!

Moreover, you can set a reminder while browsing from your PC at work and get reminded while browsing on your laptop at home!

Your reminders get synchronized securely between computers through the Chrome built-in "Synchronize My Bookmarks" functionality which can be enabled as described here: http://goo.gl/NgJv

A reminder is set in two ways. Either specify "in" what time you should be reminded, say an hour from now, or "on" what time you should be reminded, say next week at 10am.

The number on the extension icon is the count of reminders that are either coming or missed. You miss a reminder if its time comes while your browser is not working.  If the color on the icon is green then you didn't miss any reminders and if it is red then you have one or more missed reminders. Point your mouse over the RemindMe icon at any time and the tooltip shows the break down of the total number of reminder between "coming" and "missed" reminders.

Clicking on the icon will bring the popup where you can add reminders and an ordered list of the closest reminders is also shown. The size of the list is configurable through the links "0", "5", and "10". To view all reminders, including any missed ones, click on the "view and manage all" link. You can then clear reminders all at once or only some, one by one. Clicking on a reminder will show its full details.

You can also add a reminder to your Google Calendar by clicking on the reminder in the popup then clicking on the "Add to Google Calendar" on the newly opened reminder details page.

When a reminder is fired, you can now snooze it!
